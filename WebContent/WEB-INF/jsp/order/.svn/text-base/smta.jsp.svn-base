<h3>Standard Material TRANSFER AGREEMENT</h3>


PREAMBLE


WHEREAS


The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as "the Treaty")1 was adopted by the Thirty-first session of the FAO Conference on 3 November 2001 and entered into force on 29 June 2004;


The objectives of the Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity, for sustainable agriculture and food security;


The Contracting Parties to the Treaty, in the exercise of their sovereign rights over their Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, have established a Multilateral System both to facilitate access to Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and to share, in a fair and equitable way, the benefits arising from the utilization of these resources, on a complementary and mutually reinforcing basis;


Articles 4, 11, 12.4 and 12.5 of the Treaty are borne in mind;


The diversity of the legal systems of the Contracting Parties with respect to their national procedural rules governing access to courts and to arbitration, and the obligations arising from international and regional conventions applicable to these procedural rules, are recognized;


Article 12.4 of the Treaty provides that facilitated access under the Multilateral System shall be provided pursuant to a Standard Material Transfer Agreement, and the Governing Body of the Treaty, in its Resolution 1/2006 of 16 June 2006, adopted the Standard Material Transfer Agreement.



ARTICLE 1 — PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT


1.1 The present Material Transfer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "this Agreement") is the Standard Material Transfer Agreement referred to in Article 12.4 of the Treaty.


1.2 This Agreement is:


BETWEEN: (name and address of the provider or providing institution, name of authorized official, contact information for authorized official) (hereinafter referred to as "the Provider"),


AND: (name and address of the recipient or recipient institution, name of authorized official, contact information for authorized official*) (hereinafter referred to as "the Recipient").


1.3 The parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE 2 — DEFINITIONS


In this Agreement the expressions set out below shall have the following meaning:


"Available without restriction": a Product is considered to be available without restriction to others for further research and breeding when it is available for research and breeding without any legal or contractual obligations, or technological restrictions, that would preclude using it in the manner specified in the Treaty.


"Genetic material" means any material of plant origin, including reproductive and vegetative propagating material, containing functional units of heredity.


"Governing Body" means the Governing Body of the Treaty.


"Multilateral System" means the Multilateral System established under Article 10.2 of the Treaty.


"Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture" means any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture.


"Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture under Development" means material derived from the Material, and hence distinct from it, that is not yet ready for commercialization and which the developer intends to further develop or to transfer to another person or entity for further development. The period of development for the Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture under Development shall be deemed to have ceased when those resources are commercialized as a Product.


"Product" means Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture that incorporate2 the Material or any of its genetic parts or components that are ready for commercialization, excluding commodities and other products used for food, feed and processing.


"Sales" means the gross income resulting from the commercialization of a Product or Products, by the Recipient, its affiliates, contractors, licensees and lessees.

"To commercialize" means to sell a Product or Products for monetary consideration on the open market, and "commercialization" has a corresponding meaning. Commercialization shall not include any form of transfer of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture under Development.
